                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a 19-year-old actor, passionate about the outdoors, sports, and embracing new experiences. Education has played an integral role in shaping me. I take immense pride in my time spent during my sixth form years at Gordonstoun, where I held the position of Head Boy and began excelling in drama, ultimately achieving an A* at A-level. Building on my theatrical talents, I embarked on a performing arts University course, I have currently completed my first year and eagerly honing my skills.
                    While performance holds a special place in my heart, my love for the outdoors is equally profound. I find solace and joy in activities such as camping and sailing, with one of my most memorable adventures being a 3-week sailing voyage from the North of Scotland to Svalbard.
                    In addition to my artistic and outdoor pursuits, I have cultivated various hobbies and engaged in numerous sports. From a young age, I have been enthralled by the art of card magic, and I have had the privilege of performing at numerous events, such as weddings and charitable functions. On the sporting front, I have a passion for team sports, with hockey standing out as a notable favourite. During my time at university, I proudly served as the vice-captain of the university team, while also competing with my local club throughout the year.
